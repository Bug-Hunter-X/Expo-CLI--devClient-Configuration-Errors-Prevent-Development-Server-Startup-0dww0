The solution to this issue may vary depending on the specific cause of the configuration error.  There are some common steps to troubleshoot this problem:

1. **Verify Network Configuration**: Ensure that your network connection is stable and that there are no firewalls or other network restrictions that might interfere with the development server.  Try restarting your router or modem if issues persist.

2. **Check Expo CLI Installation**: Verify that you have the latest version of the Expo CLI installed.  Run `expo -v` to check the version number. If it is out of date, run `npm install -g expo-cli` to upgrade (or use your package manager of choice).

3. **Clean the Project**: Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file (if applicable). Re-install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

4. **Review Custom Configuration**: If you have made any custom configurations to your `expo.dev` file, double-check them to make sure there are no syntax errors or unexpected values.  Start by reverting any custom changes to ensure they aren't the root of the problem.

5. **Expo Go Settings**: Ensure Expo Go is correctly configured and that the necessary permissions are granted.  Restart the Expo Go application. 

6. **Choose correct devClient**: The choice of `devClient` should align with your development environment and device being used.  If you're targeting a web browser, use 'web'. If you are targeting a mobile device, try 'local'.  In some cases, omitting the setting entirely might resolve the issue.  Test various settings.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to provide more details about the specific error message you're encountering and the version of Expo CLI and other relevant packages used.
