While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the configuration of the development server. Specifically, the error message indicated a problem with the `devClient` setting within the `expo.dev` configuration.  The exact error message varied depending on the configuration, but it generally revolved around the server failing to start or connect correctly.  I tried setting the `devClient` to `'web'` and `'local'`, but to no avail. The app would not start in development mode, even after cleaning the cache and reinstalling the Expo CLI. I was using Expo Go on an Android device.
